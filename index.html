            <img src="images/about-me-image.jpeg" alt="Girl smiling in the sunset" width="500">

            <p>I have always considered myself a unique, creative, and sometimes a bit crazy person. My main goal is to be memorable in people's lives, in a way that they can remember all my flaws, but at the same time, everything I did to overcome and be better. On the other hand, I have tried many different hobbies, but the ones I enjoy the most are crocheting and occasionally playing the piano.</p>

            <p>Another thing about me is that I love an opportunity to create incredible memories and have good stories to tell later, even in the smallest moments. My main values are to try to be as genuine, spontaneous, and confident as possible. You cannot be afraid of what might happen, because I assure you that the worst that could happen is not as bad as you think. Life is made to take chances and not fear judgment from others.</p>
